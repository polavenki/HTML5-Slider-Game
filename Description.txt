Assignment Description
The assignment is to build a javascript, native android, or native iOS implementation of a 4x4 slider puzzle. Clicking or tapping on a tile should
 slide it to an open space. Clicking or tapping on a tile that can legally move multiple tiles should work as well. 
 Dragging should smoothly move tiles, including multiple tiles if a row or column can be 
pushed along. If you release, tile should smoothly move to correct spot. If move is over halfway to complete, the move should complete. 
If less than halfway, tile(s) should
 revert to original position. On multi touch devices, multiple touch points should not break the puzzle, rotate or zoom.

Your submission will be evaluated based on code quality (elegance, readability, flexibility) and feel of the implementation (responsive to touch and drags, tiles move smoothly). 

Your implementation should work well on iOS and Android mobile browsers or as a native app.
